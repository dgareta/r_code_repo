# My first version controlled file

This report documents my first attempts of using Git and GitHub to version control an RStudio project. I will be modifying this report , staging and committing changes and the  pushing to GitHub.

Let's create a test plot



```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr)

```


```{r, test_plot}

plot(cars, col = "red", xlab = "speed(mph)", ylab = "distance(miles)"
     )
summary(cars)
glimpse(cars)
head(cars)
```

## Including Plots

Here we plot a scatter plot of temperature and pressure


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

pressure |> 
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) +
geom_point()
```
A summary of the dtaframe is given below

```{r}
kable(summary(cars))

```
